## Course Description

This course covers basic techniques in probability and statistics that are important in the field of data analytics. Discrete probability models, sampling from infinite and finite populations, statistical distributions, basic Bayesian statistics, and non-parametric statistical techniques for categorical data are covered in this course. Each of these statistical concepts will be applied in a variety of real-world scenarios through the use of case studies and customized data sets.

## Course Learning Outcomes:

By then end of the course, students should be able to:

* Understand the foundations of probability theory and perform basic probability calculations.
* Build basic stochastic models for commonly encountered business problems.
* Model situations involving uncertainty using appropriate probability distributions and conditional techniques.
* Explore and summarize data using descriptive statistics.
* Test hypotheses using classical and modern computational techniques.
* Construct estimators and calculate intervals using classical and modern computational techniques.
* Perform basic Bayesian statistical techniques for estimation and testing hypotheses.

## Program Learning Outcomes addressed by the course:

* Business Understanding.  Learn when probabilistic techniques apply to certain categories of business problems, discuss the sorts of solutions that are possible, and understand the limitations of these techniques.
* Foundational Math Skills. Explore and analyze data, build probabilistic and statistical models, construct estimators, and test hypotheses.
* Predictive Modeling.  Learn foundational techniques that underlie predictive modeling algorithms, such as Naïve Bayes.
* Presentation.  Complete and submit collaborative assignments using techniques from the course.

## How is this course relevant for data analytics professionals?

Probabilistic techniques are the foundation of many data science applications from data exploration and visualization to outlier analysis, stochastic modelling, and data mining algorithms. This course will ensure that students have a strong understanding of these foundations.

## How This Course Works:

This course is conducted entirely online. Each week, you will have various resources made available, including weekly readings from the textbooks and occasionally additional readings provided by the instructor. Most weeks will have homework assignments to be submitted. There will also be a presentation required and a forum post introduction required. You are expected to complete all assignments by their due dates.

Meetup presentations will comprise the solution and presentation to the class of one of the suggested problems for study from the weekly materials (not the graded homework problems). Each student must present one problem throughout the semester. Problems are chosen by entering your name and problem [in the Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fyy-azER3lViyZUbPoSZOOdDUWtw1sq-sm2qHscPHxA/edit?usp=sharing). Note there is a maximum of three presentatiosn per meetup and presentations should be no more than five minutes. Additionally, prepare your presentation so that the slides or document (I suggest using R Markdown) will be shared on the course website. Problems are assigned first come, first served, so any problem not already chosen by another student is available.

Further details on each of these assignments will be available in Blackboard and/or [this Github repository](https://github.com/jbryer/IS606Fall2015).

## Data Project

The purpose of the data project is for you to conduct reproducible research using open access data. The final project will include an R Markdown file with all required data files so that anyone else can run your analysis. Your project will be made available to other students on this website. The proposal will be graded on a pass/fail basis. More details on the format of the project including templates are on this page: [https://github.com/jbryer/IS606Fall2015/blob/master/Project/IS606_Data_Project.md](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jbryer/IS606Fall2015/blob/master/Project/IS606_Data_Project.html)

**Important Dates:**

* **Proposal due October 19**
* **Final Project due December 7**


## Software

We will make use of [R](http://r-project.org), an open source statistics program and language. Be sure to [install R](http://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](http://rstudio.com) on your own computers within the first few days of the class.

* R - [Windows](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) or [Mac](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
* RStudio - [Download Windows or Mac version from here](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

If using Windows, you also need to download and install these:

* [RTools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
* [ActivePerl](http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads/thank-you?dl=http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePerl/releases/5.16.3.1603/ActivePerl-5.16.3.1603-MSWin32-x86-296746.msi)

Once everything is installed, execute the following command in RStudio to install the packages we will use for this class (you can copy-and-paste):

```
install.packages(c('openintro','OIdata','devtools','ggplot2','psych','reshape2',
				   'knitr','markdown'))
devtools::install_github("jbryer/IS606")
```

#### The `IS606` R Package

Many of the course resouces are available in the `IS606` R package. Here are some command to get started:

```
library('IS606')          # Load the package
vignette(package='IS606') # Lists vignettes in the IS606 package
vignette('os3')           # Loads a PDF of the OpenIntro Statistics book
data(package='IS606')     # Lists data available in the package
getLabs()                 # Returns a list of the available labs
viewLab('Lab0')           # Opens Lab0 in the default web browser
startLab('Lab0')          # Starts Lab0 (copies to getwd()), opens the Rmd file
shiny_demo()              # Lists available Shiny apps
```

#### Learning R

* [Quick-R](http://statmethods.net). Kabakoff's website. Great reference along with his book, *R in Action*.
* [O'Reilly Try R](http://tryr.codeschool.com/). Great tutorial on R where you can try R commands directly from the web browser.
* [R Reference Card](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf)
* [Video Overview of RStudio](http://vimeo.com/97166163)
* [R-Bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/)
* [Journal of Statistical Software](http://www.jstatsoft.org/)
* [The R Journal](http://journal.r-project.org/)

#### Learning R Markdown

* [Video on RMarkdown by RStudio](http://vimeo.com/94181521) - This 26 minute video talks about some updates to RMarkdown.
* [Markdown Basics](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics). Markdown is a way of formatting plain text documents mostly for the web. However, it has become for other writing tasks too. It has become popular because it focusses on writing and not formatting. The formatting is taken care later. The [Markdown Basics](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) provides a nice introduction to Markdown.
* [The R Markdown Website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) has a nice introduction on how Markdown is extended to allow for the inclusion of R code and output.
* [Video Introduction to R Markdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFe1UJrj7lc). This short video (under 4 minutes) was recorded with an older version, so not all of the features and dialog boxes will look the same, but may be helpful.

#### Creating Math Equations

Occasionally you will need to type equations in homework and labs. R Markdown supports LaTeX style equations using the [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) javascript library. I do not expect you to learn LaTeX for this course. Instead, I recommend using the free application [Daum Equation Editor](). It availabe [online](https://www.mathjax.org/), as a [Google Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/daum-equation-editor/dinfmiceliiomokeofbocegmacmagjhe?hl=en), or as a standalone [Mac Application](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CC4QFjACahUKEwiegvqQod3GAhUCmYAKHctnA5M&url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fdaum-equation-editor%2Fid540665783%3Fmt%3D12&ei=WGKmVZ72DIKyggTLz42YCQ&usg=AFQjCNH69beGYAfr5ojnPILLNOG-goN9sw&sig2=Qw7QV80X8gZjrNyY9PkMHA).
