	* Approximately six problems per chapter.
	* Answers can be handwritten or typed (I suggest using R Markdown)
	* Submit a PDF on Blackboard.
* [Labs](https://github.com/jbryer/IS606Fall2015#labs) (36%)
	* Labs are designed to introduce to you doing statistics with R.
	* Answer the questions in the main text as well as the "On Your Own" section.
	* Submit both the R Markdown file and PDF of the output on Blackboard.
* [Data Project](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jbryer/IS606Fall2015/blob/master/Project/IS606_Data_Project.html) (20%)
	* This allows you to analyze a dataset of your choosing. Projects will be shared with the class. This provides an opportunity for everyone to see different approaches to analyzing different datasets.
	* Proposal is due October 19th (5%); Final project is due December 7th (15%).
* Final exam (20%)
* Meetup Presentation (5%)
	* Present one practice problem during our weekly meetups. Signup using the [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fyy-azER3lViyZUbPoSZOOdDUWtw1sq-sm2qHscPHxA/edit?usp=sharing).


## The `IS606` R Package

The package can be installed from Github using the `devtools` package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('jbryer/IS606')
```

### Important Functions

* `library('IS606')` - Load the package
* `vignette(package='IS606')` - Lists vignettes in the IS606 package
* `vignette('os3')` - Loads a PDF of the OpenIntro Statistics book
* `data(package='IS606')` - Lists data available in the package
* `getLabs()` - Returns a list of the available labs
* `viewLab('Lab0')` - Opens Lab0 in the default web browser
* `startLab('Lab0')` - Starts Lab0 (copies to getwd()), opens the Rmd file
* `shiny_demo()` - Lists available Shiny apps

## Using R Markdown

R Markdown files are provided for all the labs. You can start a lab using the `IS606::startLab` function.

However, creating new R Markdown files in RStudio can be done by clicking `File` > `New File` > `R Markdown`.
